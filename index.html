                <br>Hello, I’m Amrit Gurung, and I hail from the beautiful town of Tokha in Kathmandu, Nepal. I am deeply passionate about personal development, creativity, and making meaningful contributions in the fields I engage with. Throughout my journey, I have cultivated a strong set of skills and experiences that have allowed me to grow both professionally and personally.
<br>
                Living in Kathmandu, a city rich in culture, history, and opportunities, has shaped my perspective and fueled my desire for innovation and excellence. I strive to approach every project with enthusiasm, adaptability, and a drive for success. Whether working on individual projects or collaborating with teams, I believe that a creative mindset and a collaborative spirit can lead to impactful results.<br>
                
                In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my work, experiences, and achievements that reflect my dedication to continuous learning and improvement. I value not just the end result, but the process of growth that comes with every challenge I face. I am always eager to learn, adapt, and push boundaries to create work that I can be proud of. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio—I look forward to connecting and sharing my journey with you.<br></p>
